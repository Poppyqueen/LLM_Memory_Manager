# which can be taken with a function in the memory_handle module 


def construct_data(memory_structure, sys_prompt="You are an agent in an text adventure game, you have to interact with the CLI, figure  out what to do and how to interact these are your deep memories System Memory Overview:\n\n"):
    """
    Constructs the data to be sent to the OpenAI API for processing in a multi-turn format.
    It expects a memory structure and a system prompt.

    Creates an initial 'developer' message containing time, base prompt, base memory,
    and long-term memory. Then, processes short-term memory entries:
    'system_' and '0_system_' keys become separate 'system' messages.
    Other keys ('user_', 'assistant_', etc.) become messages with their corresponding roles.
    Messages are added in chronological order based on short-term keys.

    Args:
        memory_structure (dict): The dictionary representing the memory structure.
                                    Expected keys: 'base_memory', 'long_term', 'short_term'.
        sys_prompt (str): The base system prompt to include in the developer message.

    Returns:
        list: A list of message dictionaries formatted for the OpenAI API.
